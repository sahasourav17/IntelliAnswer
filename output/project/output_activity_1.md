# Activity 1: WHS Plan (Assessment Task 2)

Based on the activity details and requirements provided, it appears that a structured template should be used for the response. The task involves reviewing the Best Events Catering WHS Policy and Procedures and using a Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Tool, which suggests a formalized approach. Therefore, I will format the response according to the template structure provided.

### WHS Plan (Assessment Task 2)

#### Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment

| Hazards (Actual or Foreseeable) | Description of the hazard (include enough information and examples to show that this hazard has the level of risk you are assigning) | Risk Rating | Risk Controls | Responsible |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Wet Floors                      | Spills or cleaning activities may result in wet floors, increasing the risk of slips and falls. This is particularly likely in areas near food and beverage stations. | Medium      | Use clear signage to indicate wet floors and ensure prompt cleaning and drying of spills. | Event Staff |
| Kitchen Equipment Malfunction   | Malfunctioning kitchen equipment, such as ovens or refrigerators, can lead to food spoilage or injury to staff. | High        | Conduct regular equipment checks and maintenance. Have backup equipment available. | Catering Manager |
| Food Contamination              | Improper food handling practices can lead to contamination and foodborne illnesses. | High        | Implement strict food safety protocols and conduct staff training sessions on hygiene practices. | Catering Manager |
| Crowd Control                   | Large crowds during meal times can lead to congestion and potential safety hazards. | Medium      | Coordinate with the venue's security team to manage crowd flow and ensure clear pathways. | Security Team |
| Allergic Reactions              | Guests may have food allergies that are not communicated, leading to potential health risks. | High        | Clearly label all food items with ingredients and provide allergen information. | Catering Staff |
| Electrical Hazards              | Overloaded circuits or faulty wiring can pose fire risks, especially with temporary setups. | Medium      | Ensure all electrical setups are inspected and compliant with safety standards. | Venue Staff |
| Fire Safety                     | The use of cooking equipment increases the risk of fire. | High        | Ensure fire extinguishers are accessible and staff are trained in fire safety procedures. | Catering Manager |
| Outdoor Weather Conditions      | Unpredictable weather can affect outdoor catering setups, leading to potential hazards. | Medium      | Have contingency plans for adverse weather, such as tents or indoor relocation. | Event Coordinator |
| Manual Handling                 | Lifting heavy equipment or supplies can lead to injuries among staff. | Medium      | Provide training on safe lifting techniques and use equipment to assist with heavy loads. | Catering Staff |
| Unauthorized Access             | Uncontrolled access to catering areas can lead to theft or tampering with food. | Low         | Implement access control measures and monitor entry points. | Security Team |

This structured approach ensures that all potential hazards are identified, assessed, and managed effectively to uphold the highest standards of health and safety during the "Innovate & Inspire" conference.
